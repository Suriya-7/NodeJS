## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side to build fast, scalable, and efficient applications.

### Key Features:
- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Handles multiple operations efficiently.
- **Single-Threaded**: Uses an event loop to manage concurrent requests.
- **NPM Ecosystem**: Includes a vast collection of libraries and tools.

## Why Learn Node.js?

Node.js is widely used for:
- Building **real-time web applications** (e.g., chat apps, live streaming).
- Creating RESTful APIs and backends for web applications.
- Developing scalable microservices.
- Full-stack development with frameworks like **Express.js**.

---

## Prerequisites

Before learning Node.js, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of **JavaScript**.
- Familiarity with web development concepts (HTML, CSS, HTTP).
- A code editor (e.g., **Visual Studio Code**).

## Getting Started

### Installing Node.js

1. Download Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Node.js by following the instructions for your operating system.
3. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

### Running Your First Script

1. Create a file named `app.js`:
   ```javascript
   console.log("Hello, Node.js!");
   ```
2. Run the script in the terminal:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

## Core Concepts

### Modules in Node.js

Modules are reusable pieces of code. Node.js includes **core modules**, **local modules**, and **third-party modules**.

#### Example of a Core Module:
```javascript
const os = require('os');
console.log(`Your system uptime is ${os.uptime()} seconds.`);
```

### The Event Loop

The event loop allows Node.js to handle asynchronous operations. It processes tasks like I/O operations, timers, and callbacks.

## Building a Simple HTTP Server

Create a basic HTTP server:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
  res.end('Hello, World!');
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is running at http://localhost:3000/');
});
```

Run the server:
```bash
node server.js
```
Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser to see the output.
