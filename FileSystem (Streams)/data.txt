'Streams in Node.js'
Streams in Node.js are objects that facilitate reading data from or writing data to a source in a continuous, efficient manner. They are particularly useful for handling large data sets, like files or data coming from a network, without requiring the entire data set to be loaded into memory.

'Types of Streams'
Node.js provides four types of streams:

1. Readable Streams: Used to read data.
     Examples: fs.createReadStream() for file reading, HTTP request objects.
2. Writable Streams: Used to write data.
     Examples: fs.createWriteStream() for file writing, HTTP response objects.
3. Duplex Streams: Can read and write data.
     Examples: Sockets, net.Socket.
4. Transform Streams: Duplex streams that can modify or transform data while reading or writing.
     Examples: Compression libraries like zlib.

'Advantages of Streams'
1. Memory Efficiency: Only small chunks of data are processed at a time.
2. Time Efficiency: Data processing starts as soon as it is available, without waiting for the entire data to be loaded.
